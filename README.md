# ParameterTraits3
## What's New
Active Object - Part 3 brings in a simple single-producer / single-consumer (SPSC) queue that allows one thread to publish parameter updates while another thread applies them. In other words, the Active Object pattern. With Active Object, we use the SPSC queue to serialize access to the parameter table.

Validation and Ownership Boundaries - The receiving thread validates each update using the existing ParameterTraits interface (param_validate, param_serialize, etc.) before committing it to the ParameterTable. This keeps all data integrity rules centralized in the same place as the parameter definitions.
